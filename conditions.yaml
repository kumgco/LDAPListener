# Dictionary to reference is called "user_info" and uid is stored as "uid" (sans quotes).

# Example of dictionary (anything starting with * is an LDAP attribute):
# {*uid: {*ou: {new: ["Blah"], old: ["Foo"]}}
#        {*cn: {new: ["Bloop"], old: ["Harris"]}}}

# Keep in mind that ALL keys are strings and ALL values are lists (even if there is only one string within the list).
# EXCEPT the uid. Accessing user_info[uid] will return a string containing the user id.

# Do not put "if" at beginning or semi-colon at end of statement:
# Example queries (queries must be in Python syntax):

# Before trying to access a key, ensure that it exists using "key in user_info[uid]".
# You are guaranteed to have both keys "old" and "new", but it is possible that they map to empty values.
# The uid is stored as a STRING (not list) at user_info[uid].

# REGARDING COMMANDS
# The program will run scripts in a shell without checking input.
